OpenGL

After I got the code for the Sudoku app working, I went through all the chapters that explained what 
was happening with that app (the user interface/2D graphics/audio etc) and fiddled around with 
the look of the Sudoku a little (colours and stuff). I also went through the code provided for both the 
audio and events apps and got them working in eclipse, then reviewed the code and corresponding chapters in 
Hello, Android.

I then browsed through the rest of the book, skimming through most of the chapters.
Learning how to use 3D graphics sounded interesting, so I started to read through the OpenGL chapter
and working through the example code, then tweaking the code to check that I knew what each part of the code
was doing, like changing the picture on the cube, making it opaque, having it spin at different speeds/angles etc.
